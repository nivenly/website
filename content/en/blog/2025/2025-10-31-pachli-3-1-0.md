The work to implement support for Mastodon's new "[quote posts](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/09/introducing-quote-posts/)" feature continues. It wasn't complete in time for this release cycle, but will be rolling out in Pachli Current very soon to allow as much time for feedback as possible ahead of release.

In the meantime there has also been other UI improvements and fixes, including:

- Support for re-ordering attachments when you write posts.
- A header above replies to show if it's the original poster continuing the thread or a reply from someone else.
- Improve scrolling behaviour on the Local and Federated timelines.
- Restore the ability to filter boosts from your timeline.
- Fix colour issues in the "black" theme.
