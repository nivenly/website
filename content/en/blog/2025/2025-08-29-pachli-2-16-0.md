**Pachli 2.16.0 is now available.**

New features and improvements in this version include:

### Privacy-preserving on-device translation

This allows you to translate posts on your timeline irrespective of whether or not your server operator has enabled translation.

It also works if the original post author forget to set the language of their post correctly, and works for all posts, including direct messages. 

> Feature available if installed from Google Play.

### Improved and more accessible emoji UI

The UI for finding and entering emojis has been improved to make it easier to navigate and more accessible, especially for anyone who finds it difficult to tell small emojis apart.

### Remember and restore your reading position on the Local and Federated timelines

You can now read your Local or Federated timeline in Pachli, go off and do something else, and return later to carry on readig where you left off.

See the [full Pachli 2.16.0 release post](https://pachli.app/pachli/2025/08/28/2.16.0-release.html) for more details on these and other changes.
