  Security bounty fund to sponsor contributors who responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities in popular open source Fediverse software.
---

## Background

Software inevitably has security vulnerabilities, and software for the Fediverse is no exception. Closing these vulnerabilities provides a safer, more trustworthy experience for citizens of the Fediverse. To that end, Nivenly is launching a time-and-funds-limited experimental security bounty fund to sponsor contributors who close serious security flaws in popular open source Fediverse software. As a secondary goal, we want to use this fund to help project maintainers grow their circle of contributors.

## The Fund

Individual researchers or contributors who identify or contribute a patch for a high or critical [CVSS score](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss) vulnerability in Fediverse software will receive a one-time sponsorship from the the Fund:

* High (7.0 \- 8.9) – $250 USD
* Critical (9.0+) – $500 USD

Since this is a new program and we want to gather data about how contributors will engage with it, the Fund will allocate a maximum of **$5,000 USD** between **April 1, 2025** and the end of **September 30, 2025**. Shortly before the conclusion of the experiment, Nivenly will hold a [member vote](/governance) to determine if we want to continue the program, and to establish a longer-term committee to steward and maintain the program.

During the experiment, a single contributor is limited to a **maximum payout of $1,000 USD**. Payment processing fees do not count towards an individual’s maximum payout.
