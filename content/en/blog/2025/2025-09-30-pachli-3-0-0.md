In this version -- and on servers that support it (Mastodon 4.4.0 and above, GotoSocial 0.20.0 and above) -- you can configure filters to show the content of the post while obscuring any media attached to the post.

So you could create a filter that hides photos if "spider" is mentioned in a post without hiding the text of the post.

A lot of work has also been done to prepare Pachli to support the new ["quote post"](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/09/introducing-quote-posts/) feature which will be released in Mastodon 4.5. That work is not complete yet.

See the [full Pachli 3.0.0 release post](https://pachli.app/pachli/2025/09/30/3.0.0-release.html?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=nivenly.org&utm_campaign=release-3.0.0) for more details on these and other changes.
