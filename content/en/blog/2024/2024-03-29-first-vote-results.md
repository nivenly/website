description: Results of the first Nivenly member vote
---

Earlier this month, we sent out the first Nivenly Member vote covering Pachli, 
Haidra, and general feedback.  As per our bylaws, we need 50% of the membership
to participate in a vote for quorum, and 50% of total voting members to be in
consensus for any result to be binding.  As we have 74 members, this means 37
needed to vote and 18 needed to agree to any individual item.

Unfortunately, only 14 responses were registered in total meaning that the 
results of the vote are not binding.  However, they do still provide us with a
direction from the Nivenly members, and that will help inform the decisions the
Board now makes around these issues.

Thank you very much to everyone that participated in discussions around these 
projects, and special thanks to the members that voted.

The rest of this post will cover each question in turn with the results, and 
how we are interpreting the results.

## New project proposals

### Haidra: member project, incubated project, or not a good fit for Nivenly?

This was a question we anticipated would be fairly split and indeed the results
are, with exactly 50% voting "NO" to Haidra being either a regular or incubated
project, and 50% voting "YES".

7% of the total (included in the 50% "NO" votes) voted that Haidra should 
reapply in a year with any concerns mitigated.

The Board will take this advice from the membership and decide what to do with
Haidra in our next meeting.

### Pachli: member project, incubated project, or not a good fit for Nivenly?

This was much less contentious: 78.6% voted "YES" for Pachli being adopted 
as a Nivenly project.  50% of the total voted that it could be a member project 
as opposed to an incubated project.

We don't yet have a definition of incubated project, so the Board will take 
this advice and decide what to do with Pachli in our next meeting.

## Feedback

### Did you partake in the member Q&A for Pachli or Haidra?

Only 43% said they did partake in the member Q&A for either project proposal.

The free feedback in this section points to Discord and GitHub not being the 
best options for discussion, and the onboarding to Discourse off-putting.  There
was also feedback that we could do a better job of reminding folks of what is 
actively under discussion and this is actionable feedback that we've taken on 
board.

### Do you have an account on Discourse?

71.4% of the respondants do have an account on Discourse which is encouraging 
as it suggests the issue is more around encouraging involvement rather than 
issues with onboarding.

### If we made a member-only area of GitHub for discussions, would it be preferable?

42.9% voted "YES" with 35.7% voting "NO".  The rest of the votes were evenly 
split between "Either would get more engagement", "It doesn't matter", and "Not 
sure".

We will pursue a strategy for discussions in future where we try to cover 
Discourse and GitHub and encourage both areas to get maximum coverage.

### If we made a member-only area of Discord, etc...

In contrast to the above, only 7% voted "YES" with 64.3% voting "NO".

This helps guide us towards Discourse and GitHub as our primary avenues for 
discussion.
