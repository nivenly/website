description: The board's decision on Pachli as a Nivenly project
---

In November 2023, Pachli [applied](/docs/applications/pachli/) to be a Nivenly
member project.  We have learned our lesson from how we approach Haidra's
application, so we put the question of whether we should support Pachli to
the Nivenly membership.

The results of that vote are outlined in
[this post](/blog/2024/04/13/first-vote-results/), and I'm thrilled to announce
that **Pachli is an official Nivenly project**.

Pachli plans to support multiple Mastodon-supporting apps, but has started with
an [Android app](https://pachli.app) that started as a Tusky fork.  Nik, the
maintainer and Pachli lead, is eager for any support from the community in
terms of accessibility improvements, but also has a long list of starter
projects for folks that want to get started in open source development.  It
almost goes without saying that this willingness to focus on accessibility, and
support open source growth, are key aspects that make this project a great fit
for Nivenly.

We're thrilled to welcome them on board, and if you want to get in touch with
the team you can find them on [github](https://github.com/pachli/) or (of
course) [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@pachli).
