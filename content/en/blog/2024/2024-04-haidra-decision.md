description: The board's decision on Haidra as a Nivenly project
---

In July 2023, we [announced](/blog/2023/2023-07-haidra-announcement.md) that
Haidra has joined Nivenly as a member project. Shortly afterwards, we received
feedback from the Nivenly membership that they were not supportive of this
decision. As a new foundation we had forgotten one of our core principles;
that this is a co-operative venture and we need to consult with, and
get agreement from, our membership before making large decisions. So we
did.

To ensure the discussion was well-informed, we had
[db0](https://hachyderm.io/@db0) write up a
[detailed post](/blog/2023/2023-08-haidra-deeper-dive.md) on what Haidra is and 
specifically how much, as a maintainer, he's considered ethics of AI, which was 
the crux of the concerns raised.  We also opened up
[forums for discussion](/blog/2023/2023-08-haidra-discussion.md) where we would 
be able to better understand membership concerns and, possibly, mitigate them.

On a personal note here, I am disappointed both in the lack of discourse on the 
channels we opened, and in the negative (and sometimes non-factual) response on 
other channels.  The former meant we didn't have a chance to discuss the issues 
in as much depth as we were hoping, and the latter put some of us, but 
especially db0, in a defensive position that has caused a lot of anxiety and 
stress.  For that in particular, I have apologised to db0 personally, and will
take this opportunity to do so publically: As Nivenly we could have handled 
this better and have let db0 down.

After the period allowed for discussion, we opened up the decision to the 
membership.  [The results](TODO: link to results blog post) are somewhat 
underwhelming as we did not reach quorum, meaning that not enough of the 
membership voted for the decision to be binding.  However, the direction given 
was clear and we took that into account when the board met to vote.

Ultimately, our decision is to follow the sentiment of the membership in the 
vote and **not accept Haidra as a Nivenly project**.

Personally, I think this is a missed opportunity as Haidra (and AI Horde more 
specifically) offers access to what is promising to be revolutionary technology 
without reliance on big tech companies and proprietary systems however putting 
personal opinions aside in favour of the decision of our co-operative 
membership is the whole point of Nivenly.  Ideally, we would find a way forward
for Haidra that would mollify the concerns raised by the membership but that 
requires a deeper level of engagement from the membership than we've seen so 
far.  This is something else I now have top-of-mind for the next steps for 
Nivenly: Ensuring membership engagement is meaningful and we're not only 
hearing from the loudest minority.
