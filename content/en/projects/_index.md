# What is a Nivenly Foundation Project?  

Nivenly Foundation Projects are open-source initiatives aligned with the mission and principles of the [Nivenly Foundation](https://nivenly.org/). They aim to solve complex challenges, foster innovation, and promote collaboration within their respective domains. By being a part of the Nivenly ecosystem, these projects gain access to resources, expertise, and a supportive community.  

## What Does It Mean to Be a Nivenly Foundation Project?  

To be a Nivenly Project means being part of a shared vision for open, sustainable, and impactful development. These projects operate under the governance and guidance of the Nivenly Foundation, adhering to its principles of transparency, sustainability, autonomy, and project control.  

Nivenly Projects are empowered to remain autonomous in their technical and community decisions while benefiting from the Foundation's overarching support. The Nivenly Foundation was intentionally designed to have a light framework, allowing contributors to "build the plane in flight." This approach ensures that projects can evolve organically, adapting to the needs of their communities and contributors. By providing this flexible structure, the Nivenly Foundation fosters an environment where innovation thrives and solutions are tailored to real-world demands.
