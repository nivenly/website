## Context and Summary 

The Job Seekers' Council (JSC) provides a space for people to create mutually beneficial resource pools to help with the job search in what is currently a heavily disrupted industry. The JSC uses working groups to help people focus on providing specific skill(s) and need(s) that support the job search process.

## Quick Guide

### Pooling resources to manage the job market: reciprocity

The goal of the JSC is for members to collectively create and sustain a resource pool. To do this, members share both what they are seeking and how they contribute as part of joining. What does this look like? Here are two examples.

First:

> Jayne Cobb \
> Career / day job: engineering, hiring manager, director-level; not currently looking for employment \
> Offering: mock interviews, interview advice, portfolio review \
> Seeking: not currently seeking, here to help.

Second:

> Theo Putnam \
> Career / day job: past jobs in cybersecurity, currently looking for employment \
> Offering: portfolio reviews for security, helping build working groups and JSC in general \
> Seeking: networking for security jobs, accountability buddy for job applications

The idea is that the membership pool of the JSC allows people to work together so that cumulatively we can review résumés, host mock interviews, extend professional networks, and so on.

### When I join, what should I "do first"?

Or in other words, "how to be onboarded in roughly five minutes". You'll need to accomplish two things, that unlock a few more things:

* The Nivenly Job Seekers' Form
    * The Nivenly Job Seekers' GitHub Repository
    * Calendar invites for JSC meetings
* The Nivenly Community Discord
    * Ask questions!

#### The Job Seekers' Form

We currently have a [Google Form to Join the JSC](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJ_LeotiJ7NLKLPL_DrIsZfqWcjYcStng9fMoXmvK1zd2ByQ/viewform). The Google Form asks a few things, notably what you are seeking and what you are providing (pooling resources), your email (for calendar invites to the JSC meetings), and your GitHub Handle (for access to the Job Seekers' materials repository).

The JSC's GitHub repository is where the in-group materials are being created for how to help with job searches and coordinate results. It is also where members can seek and offer help in certain areas (based on the resources sought or offered).

Your email and GitHub will not be used for any other purpose, not even within Nivenly as an organization. There are separate acknowledgements for each about this.

#### The Nivenly Community Discord

[Nivenly's Community Discord](https://discord.gg/rUQH4PAmY9) is where the Nivenly Community interacts, including the members of the JSC. When you join, you will need to accept the server rules prior to accessing the rest of the Discord. As an anti-spam measure, depending on the age of your account, it may take up to 10 minutes for access to the rest of the Discord to appear.

Once you are in the Discord, head on over to the `#jsc-watercooler` to say hello, start asking questions, offering assistance, or participate in any ongoing chatter. We're all here to help! You can find the channel by using cmd+K or ctrl+K on your keyboard.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Quick note</span>: all accounts need to be verified by default as an antispam measure. If you would like access to the Discord, but do not want to verify your account with Discord, just ping the Discord Mods (that's their handle) in the `##intro` channel (the channel that it puts you in when you join the Discord) or DM `quintessence`.

### When I join, what should I "do next"?

As you start to feel more comfortable participating in the group, some things you might want to consider doing as time goes on:

* Attend meetings
* Join or start a working group
* Increase the JSC's job seeking resources

## FAQ

### Is this group a good fit for me?

Are you:

* Looking for work, or looking to assist those who are?
* Interested in a collaborative approach to doing so?

Then this is a great way to accomplish both of those goals.

### Can I join if I'm currently employed and/or not currently seeking a job?

Yes.

You can join whether you're employed and looking for your next job, or are currently happily employed and simply want to help others.

### How it works

The JSC is a Group of Groups. To put it another way, while each working group has a focus (e.g. “Black job seekers”, “AWS”, “Career Transition”, "Mock Interviews", "Résumé Help", etc.), the groups still work together as a collective. Groups can have two types of membership:

* Open to Join - any member of the JSC may join.
* Request to Join - members of the JSC request the group leaders to join, and the group leaders determine membership.

Anyone can join as many groups as they wish and assist in running as many groups as they can give their time to.

Groups also have two types of duration:

* Ephemeral 
* Ongoing

Ephemeral groups typically spin up to complete a specific task (e.g. this doc page), whereas ongoing groups (e.g. "Mock Interview") are indefinite.

### How do the working group(s) function and communicate 

Working groups start as chatter in the main `#jsc-watercooler` channel. As the group's needs change, for example if they're a Request to Join group or the group becomes large in size, they may split into their own channels with permissions set as needed.

### How do I create a new working group?

New working groups are created by generating a (short) proposal and then presenting it at the weekly JSC meeting.

### Does each working group need to be unique? Can I create another working group?

The goal is for the groups to be both effective and psychologically safe. That means that you can create a new working group that overlaps, partially or entirely, with an existing group.

### Do I need to attend meetings to access resources?

No, meetings are for running the group itself.

That said, there are a couple situations where you'd need to join a meeting:

* Working groups need to provide updates in the general meeting. By default this is usually the facilitator, but it does not need to be.
* Any member can add agenda items to the agenda, so if you have a topic you'd like to discuss, brainstorm, a proposal, etc., you can add it to the agenda.

### Should I attend meetings?

The goal is for the JSC membership to collectively decide on how the JSC functions and make decisions relevant to its ongoing governance. We recommend as many members attend as possible, especially during these early meetings where we're building the framework for the JSC itself. This is to ensure breadth and depth of experience and needs are designed into the fabric of the JSC.
