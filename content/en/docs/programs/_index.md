Collection of programs run by the Nivenly Foundation. Programs are added this section as they are launched, accompanied by a blog post. They are initially limited in time and funds, and Nivenly will hold a [member vote](/governance) to determine if we want to continue the program, and to establish a longer-term committee to steward and maintain the program.
