- Design and UX: Create wireframes, mockups, or accessibility improvements.

### How to Find a Good First Issue

#### Where to Look

- GitHub Issue Tracker: Most Nivenly projects tag issues based on difficulty and priority. Look for tags such as:

“Good First Issue”
“Help Wanted”
“Docs”

- Project Documentation: Check the “Contributing” section in the project’s documentation. Many projects list beginner-friendly tasks explicitly.
- Community Channels: Join the project’s chat or discussion forums to ask about current opportunities.

#### Tips for Getting Started

- Start with small, well-defined issues to familiarize yourself with the project.
- Engage with maintainers by commenting on the issue before starting work.
- Follow up on any feedback provided during code reviews or discussions.
- If you find a gap or missing information in the documentation for one of our projects, check the existing open issues before opening a new pull request/issue. 
- If your issue doesn’t already exist, open a new issue detailing your suggested change. This is particularly necessary if it’s a larger issue spanning multiple areas/that may potentially take more time/involve more than a few individuals or rounds of feedback.
- For smaller contributions, you can open a PR with your fix.
